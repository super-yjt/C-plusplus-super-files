At first, under the guidance of a friend, I tried to learn Python, but there was really not much time, for Python just learned the basics, should be to learn alone, over time interest gradually weakened, then for nearly half a year without contact with programming, later the school club organized C++ learning, I should have learned programming, so with curiosity, joined the club, this time is not like before alone, finally have a partner to study with me, I finally have great interest These documents are my learning results, and I look forward to what I will do better and better in the future!
